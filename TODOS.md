# TODOS

Items deferred from CEO plan review of `tauri-migration` branch
(2026-03-16). Ordered by priority.

## P1 — Must fix soon

### ~~1. Attachment permission ordering bug~~ DONE

Moved `ATTACH_FILES` permission check before `CreateMessage()`
in `Server/ws/handlers.go`. Added test
`TestChatSend_AttachmentsDeniedNoMessageCreated`.

---

### ~~2. Hardcoded `/api/files/` URL~~ DONE

Changed to `/api/v1/files/` in
`Server/db/attachment_queries.go:93`.

---

### ~~3. Missing `onUnauthorized` handler~~ DONE

Wired `api.onUnauthorized` callback at creation in `main.ts`
to call `clearAuth()`, which triggers navigation back to
connect page via existing authStore subscription.

---

## P2 — Should fix next

### ~~4. Silent API failure toasts~~ DONE

Added `ToastContainer` to `MainPage.ts`. Wired toast to 5
catch blocks: `loadMessages`, `loadOlderMessages`,
`openInviteManager`, `togglePinnedPanel`, and the connectivity
guard on message send.

---

### ~~5. Message send connectivity guard + debounce~~ DONE

Added `ws.getState() !== "connected"` guard in `MainPage.ts`
`onSend` callback with toast feedback. Added 200ms send
debounce in `MessageInput.ts` to prevent double-click
duplicates.

---

### ~~6. WebSocket frame size limit on server~~ DONE

Added `conn.SetReadLimit(1 << 20)` (1MB) in
`Server/ws/serve.go` after WebSocket accept.

---

### ~~7. Wrap dispatcher store operations in try/catch~~ N/A

Already handled: `ws.ts` dispatch function wraps every
listener call in try/catch with `log.error`. No additional
wrapping needed in `dispatcher.ts`.

---

### ~~8. `GetAttachmentsByMessageIDs` error silently swallowed~~ DONE

Added `slog.Error("ws handleChatSend GetAttachments", ...)` in
`Server/ws/handlers.go` inside the error check.

---

## P3 — Tech debt / polish

### ~~9. Split oversized files~~ DONE

Split all three targets:

- `Server/admin/api.go` (788→281 lines) into
  `handlers_users.go`, `handlers_channels.go`,
  `handlers_settings.go`, `handlers_backup.go`
- `Client/tauri-client/src/components/SettingsOverlay.ts`
  (~685→173 lines) into 7 per-tab modules under
  `components/settings/`
- `Client/tauri-client/src/pages/MainPage.ts` (703→508
  lines) into `pages/main-page/ChatHeader.ts` and
  `pages/main-page/OverlayManagers.ts`

---

### ~~10. Extract permission check helper (server DRY)~~ DONE

Created `requireChannelPerm(c, channelID, perm, permLabel)`
helper in `handlers.go`. Replaced 8 instances across
`handlers.go` and `voice_handlers.go`.

---

### ~~11. Virtual scrolling for MessageList~~ DONE

Implemented DOM windowing in `MessageList.ts`. Only visible
messages plus 10-item overscan buffer are in the DOM.
Uses estimated heights (52px) with measured-height cache,
top/bottom spacer elements, and `requestAnimationFrame`
debounced scroll updates. Rendering helpers extracted to
`components/message-list/renderers.ts`.

---

### ~~12. WS message render batching~~ DONE

Added `queueMicrotask`-based notification batching to
`createStore` in `store.ts`. Multiple rapid `setState`
calls now coalesce into a single subscriber notification
with the final state. Added `flush()` method for
synchronous test assertions.

---

### ~~13. E2E test improvement plan (Phases 4-6)~~ DONE

Completed all remaining E2E improvement phases:

- Phase 4: Strengthened assertions in server-strip,
  main-layout, user-bar, message-input specs. Fixed
  "presence_update" test title in member-list.spec.ts.
- Phase 5: Replaced skipped toast.spec.ts with 5 real
  tests (load failure, auto-dismiss, container check,
  message display, stacking). Added
  mockTauriFullSessionWithFailingMessages helper.
- Phase 6: Migrated 12 spec files to data-testid selectors
  for all primary elements.

---

## CLIENT-REVIEW.md findings

### ~~Auth token never set in authStore~~ DONE

Fixed in `main.ts:wirePostAuth` — store token in authStore
before WS connect so dispatcher's `auth_ok` handler has it.

---

### ~~WS connect hangs in "connecting" state~~ DONE

Fixed in `ws.ts` — set state to "disconnected" when Tauri
APIs are unavailable.

---

### ~~Server-driven voice disconnect doesn't clear currentChannelId~~ DONE

Fixed in `dispatcher.ts` — `voice_leave` handler now calls
`leaveVoiceChannel()` when the current user is removed.

---

### ~~Theme/font not applied on app start~~ DONE

Extracted `applyStoredAppearance()` from `SettingsOverlay.ts`
and call it at app startup in `main.ts`.

---

### ~~Infinite scroll throttle~~ DONE

Fixed in `MessageList.ts` — replaced fixed 500ms timeout
with store subscription that resets `loadingOlder` when
message count changes. Also checks `hasMoreMessages` before
triggering scroll load.
