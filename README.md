# OwnCord

*The gaming chat platform you actually own.*

> **Early Alpha — Building in the Open**
> OwnCord is under active development and is not production-ready. Do not use it for sensitive communications. Security hardening is in progress. Contributions and [security reports](https://github.com/J3vb/OwnCord/issues) are welcome.

A self-hosted Windows chat platform with real-time messaging,
voice/video, file sharing, and a web admin panel. Run your own
server and keep everything under your control — zero cloud
dependencies, works fully on LAN.

## Quick Start

1. Download `chatserver.exe` and the OwnCord installer from
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/J3vb/OwnCord/releases)
2. Run `chatserver.exe` — generates `config.yaml` and a `data/`
   directory (database, TLS certs, uploads, backups) on first run
3. Open `https://localhost:8443/admin` to create the Owner account
4. Generate an invite code in the admin panel and share it
5. Friends install the client, enter your server address
   (`ip:8443`), and register with the invite code
> Note: You should locate your active IPv4 via `ipconfig` for Win or `ip a` for Linux, since OwnCord server runs on `0.0.0.0`.
>
> Example: 192.168.1.2:8443

The client uses TOFU (Trust On First Use) for self-signed
certificates — it prompts to trust the server on first
connection, then pins it for future sessions.

### Voice & Video Setup (Optional)

Voice and video require [LiveKit Server](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/releases):

1. Download `livekit-server` from the LiveKit releases page
2. Edit `config.yaml` and set:
   ```yaml
   voice:
     livekit_api_key: "devkey"           # any string
     livekit_api_secret: "secret-min-32-characters-long!!"  # min 32 chars
     livekit_binary: "C:/path/to/livekit-server.exe"
   ```
3. Restart `chatserver.exe` — it auto-starts LiveKit as a
   companion process

### Networking

For friends outside your LAN, you need to forward these ports:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| `8443` | TCP | HTTPS, WebSocket, REST API |
| `7881` | TCP | LiveKit signaling (voice/video) |
| `50000-60000` | UDP | LiveKit WebRTC media (voice/video) |

Alternatively, use Tailscale for zero-config networking
with no port forwarding.

## Architecture

Two components: a **Go server** and a **Tauri v2 client**
(Rust + TypeScript).

                                |  |  SQLite DB    |  |
                                |  +---------------+  |
                                +---------------------+
```

- **WebSocket** — chat messages, typing, presence, voice signaling
- **REST API** — message history, file uploads, channel management, auth
- **LiveKit** — voice and video via LiveKit SFU (companion process)

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- Node.js 20+
- Rust (stable)
- Windows 10/11

### Server

```bash
cd Server
go build -o chatserver.exe -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=1.0.0" .
```

### Client

```bash
cd Client/tauri-client
npm install
npm run tauri build
```

The installer is output to
`Client/tauri-client/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Server
cd Server && go test ./...
cd Server && go test ./... -cover   # with coverage

# Client
cd Client/tauri-client
npm test                    # all tests (vitest)
npm run test:unit           # unit tests only
npm run test:integration    # integration tests
npm run test:e2e            # Playwright E2E (mocked Tauri)
npm run test:e2e:native     # Playwright E2E (real Tauri exe + CDP)
npm run test:coverage       # coverage report

# Type checking & linting
npm run typecheck           # full typecheck
npm run lint                # ESLint check
npm run lint:fix            # ESLint auto-fix
```

## Configuration

The server generates a `config.yaml` on first run. All runtime data
is stored in a `data/` directory alongside the executable:

```text
data/
├── owncord.db         # SQLite database
├── certs/             # TLS certificates (auto-generated if self_signed)
├── uploads/           # User-uploaded files
└── backups/           # Database backups
```

Key settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `server.port` | `8443` | HTTPS port |
| `server.name` | `OwnCord Server` | Display name |
| `tls.mode` | `self_signed` | TLS mode (self_signed, acme, manual, off) |
| `upload.max_size_mb` | `100` | Max upload size |
| `voice.livekit_url` | `ws://localhost:7880` | LiveKit server WebSocket URL |
| `voice.livekit_api_key` | — | LiveKit API key (required for voice) |
| `voice.livekit_api_secret` | — | LiveKit API secret (min 32 chars, required for voice) |
| `voice.livekit_binary` | — | Path to `livekit-server` binary (empty = don't auto-start) |
| `voice.quality` | `medium` | Voice quality (low, medium, high) |
| `server.admin_allowed_cidrs` | private nets | CIDRs allowed to access `/admin` |
| `github.token` | — | Token for update checks (optional, for higher rate limits) |

## Auto-Updates

The client checks for updates after connecting to the server.
Updates are Ed25519-signed and verified before install.

To enable signed releases in CI, add these GitHub repository secrets:

- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` — Ed25519 private key
  (via `npx tauri signer generate`)
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` — key password
